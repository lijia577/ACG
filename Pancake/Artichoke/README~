BREIF DESCRIPTION
	This program helps users to visualize a baby name data set ranging
	from 1900-2013. Users will be able to query the data set and visu-
	alize it with histograms. Users can choose to query by name and/or
	by total ranking. 

HOW TO RUN:

	open your terminal and do the following:
		$ make
		$ ./proj8  [-gGENDER] [-rRank] [-nName]
	
	
	NOTE the order of flags are interchangable. You need to have either
	-r or -n at least. Otherwise the program will yell at you. You might
	want to follow the prompt or refer to the following examples. If you
	don't specify the gender, the program will return both gender.
	
		./proj8 -nEden -r20      ---------- Good, with -g Omitted
		./proj8 -r20 -nEden -gF  ---------- Good
		./proj8 -r20			 ---------- Good	
    
	**Putting console into FULL SCREEN for best result**

Questions answered:

1. what data structure you use for building index on total ranks?

	A: I used a singly linked list to build total ranks index. To be 
	more specific, I obtained the list to store names and converted 
	it to total ranks. The head nodes of the list are called brlhead
	(stands for boy rank list) and grlhead (stands for girl rank list).
	
2. what data structure you use for building index on names? 

	A: I also used a singly list for that. Again, the naming convention
	of head node in this program is gnlhead(girl name list) and bnlhead 
	(boy name list). 
	
3. what is the complexity of searching by name for your program?
	
	A: The complexity of searching by name is O(logN). Because the singly
	list described in question 1 is converted into a balanced search tree,
	where search is done in O(logN) time.

4. what is the complexity of searching by rank for your program?

	A: The complexity of searching by rank is O(N). I used singly linked 
	list, where search only requires at more O(N), because there are only
	N elements that needs to be iterated. 
	
5. what algorithm you use for freeing memories?

	A: For trees, I used recursion to free memories. For linkedlist, I start
	at the head, traverse the entire list. I free the current node but saved
	the pointer to the next and etc.
	
6. how to run your program? 

	A: Follow the instructions below, use flags to specify different options:
	$ make
	$ ./proj8 [-gGENDER] [-rRank] [-nName]
	
	(Note that the order of flags does not matter. No space are allowed between
	a certain flag and its argument. For example:
	$./proj8 -nEmily -r20    ------is correct, with gender ommited.
	$./proj8 -nEden -gF -r20 ------is correct.
	$./proj8 -n Emily        ------is NOT correct. The space means name is empty.)
	
7. what a user should expect from your program.
	
	A: A user should follow the prompt when entering flags and runing the 
	program. A user will be able to query and visualization the babynames
	dataset with a histogram by using rank flag (-r) and/or name flag(-n).
