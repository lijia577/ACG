Error log:

I want the BNL (boy name list) to insert in order. Meaning when inserting, all the stuff should already be in the right order.
however, insertInOrderBNL function is not working properly now.

This is the overall design idea for this project.

Read functions line by line. Using fgets() for line by line. 

def update:
	update the total number of babies in the totalStruct for that node.
	create a new yearStruct and append at the end of the linkedList. 

def createNew:
	create new totalStruct and a new year Struct. All the stuff in the 
		totalStruct and yearStruct should be almost the same. 
	count the uniNameNum. 
	Insert the this new node into nameList, where all the names are inserted 
        	in alphabetical order. 
	Insert the new node also into a rankList, just append it there. 
	
def process:
	group update and createNew togother; 	
	if(nameExist) update;
	else:
		createNew;

For each line:
	if(male):
		process;
		(do the male side)
	else:
		process;

#When the above is done. You will have two lists: nameList and the rankList.
#the nameList is already sorted. The Rank list is not. Because the rank will 
#not be complete until all the lines are loaded. 


//FOR BOTH GENDER:

qsort(rankList, uniNameNum, compRankFunc);

#when both lists are sorted, convert then into bst. 
convertIntoBST(rankList);
convertIntoBST(nameList);

//END BOTH GENDER
